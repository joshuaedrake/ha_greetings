This project aims to create an AI model that chooses the most appropriate pre-recorded personalized greeting for the person opening the front door.
The model will learn the pre-recorded greetings and incorporate logic, based factors like the pin used, the time, weather, and frequency of the pin used to determine the most appropriate.
Home assistant will trigger the automation, this model will determine the greeting, then Home Assistant will play the media on the selected speaker.
I created the greetings on elevenlabs.io. They have some great voices and an incredibly user friendly, intuitive site.
